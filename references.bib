Patient: Thanks, that is pretty clear. Doctor: By the way, the 95\% confidence interval for this prediction is 62\% to 78\%. Patient: What does that tell me? Doctor: It means that I don't know exactly how many of the 100 men will be alive 5 years later, but I expect between 62 and 78 will. My best guess is still 70, but this is a range for my guess. Patient: Does that mean at least 62 but no more than 78 will be alive? Doctor: No, but fewer than 62 or more than 78 is quite unlikely. Patient: Where does the 95\% come in? Doctor: The casual interpretation is that there is only a 5\% chance that fewer than 62 or more than 78 men will be alive in 5 years. Technically, that's not correct. Instead, all I can say is that if I repeated my work of estimating that interval an infinite number of times, 95\% of my infinite attempts would successfully include the true risk that you face. Of course, I can't make a definitive statement about the particular interval I just quoted for you.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Clinical prediction models are estimated using a sample of limited size from the target population, leading to uncertainty in predictions, even when the model is correctly specified. Generally, not all patient profiles are observed uniformly in model development. As a result, sampling uncertainty varies between individual patients' predictions. We aimed to develop an intuitive measure of individual prediction uncertainty. The variance of a patient's prediction can be equated to the variance of the sample mean outcome in hypothetical patients with the same predictor values. This hypothetical sample size can be interpreted as the number of similar patients that the prediction is effectively based on, given that the model is correct. For generalized linear models, we derived analytical expressions for the effective sample size. In addition, we illustrated the concept in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In model development, can be used to balance accuracy versus uncertainty of predictions. In a validation sample, the distribution of indicates which patients were more and less represented in the development data, and whether predictions might be too uncertain for some to be practically meaningful. In a clinical setting, the effective sample size may facilitate communication of uncertainty about predictions. We propose the effective sample size as a clinically interpretable measure of uncertainty in individual predictions. Its implications should be explored further for the development, validation and clinical implementation of prediction models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background. Treatment decision making is often guided by evidence-based probabilities, which may be presented to patients during consultations. These probabilities are intrinsically imperfect and embody 2 types of uncertainties: aleatory uncertainty arising from the unpredictability of future events and epistemic uncertainty arising from limitations in the reliability and accuracy of probability estimates. Risk communication experts have recommended disclosing uncertainty. We examined whether uncertainty was discussed during cancer consultations and whether and how patients perceived uncertainty. Methods. Consecutive patient consultations with medical oncologists discussing adjuvant treatment in early-stage breast cancer were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded. Patients were interviewed after the consultation to gain insight into their perceptions of uncertainty. Results. In total, 198 patients were included by 27 oncologists. Uncertainty was disclosed in 49\% (97/197) of consultations. In those 97 consultations, 23 allusions to epistemic uncertainty were made and 84 allusions to aleatory uncertainty. Overall, the allusions to the precision of the probabilities were somewhat ambiguous. Interviewed patients mainly referred to aleatory uncertainty if not prompted about epistemic uncertainty. Even when specifically asked about epistemic uncertainty, 1 in 4 utterances referred to aleatory uncertainty. When talking about epistemic uncertainty, many patients contradicted themselves. In addition, 1 in 10 patients seemed not to realize that the probabilities communicated during the consultation are imperfect. Conclusions. Uncertainty is conveyed in only half of patient consultations. When uncertainty is communicated, oncologists mainly refer to aleatory uncertainty. This is also the type of uncertainty that most patients perceive and seem comfortable discussing. Given that it is increasingly common for clinicians to discuss outcome probabilities with their patients, guidance on whether and how to best communicate uncertainty is urgently needed.},

Design  A survey of stakeholders’ opinions on the proposals. Setting  A web-based survey, open to international participation, for those with an interest in visualisation of time-to-event data. Participants  1174 people participated in the survey over a 6-week period. Participation was global (although primarily Europe and North America) and represented a wide range of researchers (primarily statisticians and clinicians). Main outcome measures  Two outcome measures were of principal importance: (1) participants’ opinions of each proposal compared with a ‘standard’ Kaplan–Meier plot; and (2) participants’ overall ranking of the proposals (including the standard).
Results  Most proposals were more popular than the standard Kaplan–Meier plot. The most popular proposals in the two categories, respectively, were an extended table beneath the plot depicting the numbers at risk, censored and having experienced an event at periodic timepoints, and CIs around each Kaplan–Meier curve.
Conclusions  This study produced a high response number, reflecting the importance of graphics for time-toevent data. Those producing and publishing Kaplan–Meier plots—both authors and journals—should, as a starting point, consider using the combination of the two favoured proposals.},

This normal approximation-based method can be looked as a Wald type confidence interval for a binomial proportion, the survival probability, using the “effective” sample size defined by Cutler and Ederer. Wald-type binomial confidence interval has been shown to perform poorly comparing to other methods. We choose three methods of binomial confidence intervals for the construction of confidence interval for survival probability: Wilson's method, Agresti–Coull's method, and higher-order asymptotic likelihood method. The methods of “effective” sample size proposed by Peto et al. and Dorey and Korn are also considered. The Greenwood formula is far from satisfactory, while confidence intervals based on the three methods of binomial proportion using Cutler and Ederer's “effective” sample size have much better performance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of two adjuvant therapy regimens in improving surgical cure rates in stage III (Dukes stage C) colon cancer.
DESIGN: Randomized, concurrently controlled clinical trial.
SETTING: Major cancer centers, universities, and community clinics affiliated with the North Cancer Treatment Group, the Southwest Oncology Group, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.
PATIENTS: Those who had had curative-intent resections of stage III colon cancer in the previous 1 to 5 weeks.
INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned to observation only, to levamisole alone (50 mg orally three times/d for 3 days, repeated every 2 weeks for 1 year), or to this regimen of levamisole plus fluorouracil (450 mg/m2 body surface area intravenously daily for 5 days and then, beginning at 28 days, weekly for 48 weeks).
MEASUREMENTS: Rates of cancer recurrence and death. Early- and late-treatment side effects.
RESULTS: With all 929 eligible patients able to be followed for 5 years or more (median follow-up, 6.5 years), fluorouracil plus levamisole reduced the recurrence rate by 40\% (P {\textless} 0.0001) and the death rate by 33\% (P = 0.0007). Levamisole reduced the recurrence rate by only 2\% and the death rate by only 6\%. With few exceptions, toxicity was mild and patient compliance was excellent. No evidence of late side effects was seen.
CONCLUSION: Fluorouracil plus levamisole is tolerable adjuvant therapy to surgery; it has been confirmed to substantially increase cure rates for patients with high-risk (stage III) colon cancer. It should be considered standard treatment for all such patients not entered into clinical trials.},

	abstract = {It is difficult to determine the pathologic stage of a clinically localized prostate cancer by physical examination or imaging studies. Consequently, clinicians rely on predictive models that estimate the probability of lymph node metastases and other pathologic features from clinical factors such as the clinical T stage, the grade in the biopsy specimen, and the serum prostate-specific antigen level. These models do not, however, directly predict prognosis. In developing a tool for predicting the probability that prostate cancer might recur after treatment, we took a novel approach that focused on the risk for the individual patient. In particular, we chose to develop a tool that calculates a continuous probability of recurrence rather than placing the patient in a risk group. This represents a fundamental departure from the classical goal of staging; a departure we argue is long overdue. Clinically localized prostate cancer patients deserve the most accurate and tailored predictions available, which current staging systems do not provide. Such an individualized approach should add value in medical decision making whenever an accurate prediction of the outcome may guide treatment selection.},

Levamisole plus 5-FU, and to a lesser extent levamisole alone, reduced cancer recurrence in comparison with no adjuvant therapy. These differences, after correction for imbalances in prognostic variables, were only suggestive for levamisole alone (P = .05) but quite significant for levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .003). Whereas both treatment regimens were associated with overall improvements in survival, these improvements reached borderline significance only for stage C patients treated with levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .03). Therapy was clinically tolerable with either regimen and severe toxicity was uncommon. These promising results have led to a large national intergroup confirmatory trial currently in progress.},

The challenge is to communicate the inherent scientific uncertainty — especially about the underlying quality of the evidence — whilst supporting informed decision making. Little is known about the effects that such scientific uncertainty has on people’s judgments of the information. In three experimental studies (total N=6,489), we investigate the influence of scientific uncertainty about the quality of the evidence on people’s perceived trustworthiness of the information and decision making. We compare the provision of high, low, and ambiguous quality-of-evidence indicators against providing no such cues. Results show an asymmetric relationship: people react more strongly to cues of low quality of evidence than they do to high quality of evidence compared to no cue. While responses to a cue of high quality of evidence are not significantly different from no cue; a cue of low or uncertain quality of evidence is accompanied by lower perceived trustworthiness and lower use of the information in decision making. Cues of uncertain quality of evidence have a similar effect to those of low quality. These effects do not change with the addition of a reason for the indicated quality level. Our findings shed light on the effects of the communication of scientific uncertainty on judgment and decision making, and provide insights for evidence-based communications and informed decision making for policy makers and the public.},

In the “posttruth” era where facts are increasingly contested, a common assumption is that communicating uncertainty will reduce public trust. However, a lack of systematic research makes it difficult to evaluate such claims. We conducted five experiments—including one preregistered replication with a national sample and one field experiment on the BBC News website (total n = 5,780)—to examine whether communicating epistemic uncertainty about facts across different topics (e.g., global warming, immigration), formats (verbal vs. numeric), and magnitudes (high vs. low) influences public trust. Results show that whereas people do perceive greater uncertainty when it is communicated, we observed only a small decrease in trust in numbers and trustworthiness of the source, and mostly for verbal uncertainty communication. These results could help reassure all communicators of facts and science that they can be more open and transparent about the limits of human knowledge.},

Shared decision-making (SDM) is advocated as the model for decision-making in preference-sensitive decisions. In this paper we sketch the history of the concept of SDM, evidence on the occurrence of the steps in daily practice, and provide a clinical audience with communication strategies to support the steps involved. Finally, we discuss ways to improve the implementation of SDM.
Results
The plea for SDM originated almost simultaneously in medical ethics and health services research. Four steps can be distinguished: (1) the professional informs the patient that a decision is to be made and that the patient's opinion is important; (2) the professional explains the options and their pros and cons; (3) the professional and the patient discuss the patient's preferences and the professional supports the patient in deliberation; (4) the professional and patient discuss the patient’s wish to make the decision, they make or defer the decision, and discuss follow-up. In practice these steps are seen to occur to a limited extent.
Discussion
Knowledge and awareness among both professionals and patients as well as tools and skills training are needed for SDM to become widely implemented.
Practice Implications
Professionals may use the steps and accompanying communication strategies to implement SDM.},

In the face of uncertainty about the patient’s prognosis and the best course of treatment, many physicians revert to a model of nondisclosure and nondiscussion, thus closing off opportunities for shared decision making. Empirical studies suggest that physicians find it more difficult to adhere to norms of disclosure in situations where there is substantial uncertainty. They may be concerned that acknowledging their own uncertainty will undermine patient trust and create additional confusion and anxiety for the patient. We argue, in contrast, that effective disclosure will protect patient trust in the long run and that patients can manage information about uncertainty. In situations where there is substantial uncertainty, extra vigilance is required to ensure that patients are given the tools and information they need to participate in cooperative decision making about their care.},

In this article we revisit this issue and examine the performance of the nonparametric procedure for estimation not only of a point on the survival curve, but also of the mean (or restricted mean) lifetime. In addition to the exponential and Weibull families, we consider the performance of the Kaplan–Meier procedure relative to a more flexible parametric model proposed by Efron. We find that the reduction in efficiency of the Kaplan–Meier survival estimate becomes negligible fairly quickly as the number of parameters in the parametric model increases. Moreover, for estimation of the mean or restricted mean, the loss in efficiency, even relative to the exponential distribution, is small or nil. We conclude that a parametric estimate of the survival curve may be necessary in certain extreme situations, such as when the sample size is very small. In these cases, careful attention must be given to considering the degree of fit, although with sparse data, this must be assessed from outside sources. For certain functionals of the survival curve, such as the mean or restricted mean, the nonparametric approach is unbiased and entails little or no loss in efficiency, and therefore would generally be preferred over a parametric-based estimate.},

	abstract = {According to Jacob Bernoulli, even the ‘stupidest man’ knows that the larger one's sample of observations, the more confidence one can have in being close to the truth about the phenomenon observed. Two-and-a-half centuries later, psychologists empirically tested people's intuitions about sample size. One group of such studies found participants attentive to sample size; another found participants ignoring it. We suggest an explanation for a substantial part of these inconsistent findings. We propose the hypothesis that human intuition conforms to the ‘empirical law of large numbers’ and distinguish between two kinds of tasks–one that can be solved by this intuition (frequency distributions) and one for which it is not sufficient (sampling distributions). A review of the literature reveals that this distinction can explain a substantial part of the apparently inconsistent results. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We illustrate these points through consideration of the literature on oxytocin and human trust, a research area that typifies some of the endemic problems that arise with poor statistical practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Individual prediction uncertainty is an important aspect of algorithm performance that is not captured by standard performance metrics such as discrimination and calibration. A prediction algorithm may be sufficiently trustworthy for some patients but not for others, raising concerns about algorithmic fairness. The effective sample size has been proposed as an intuitive measure of sampling uncertainty in predictions from generalized linear models. We aimed to compute effective sample sizes for a wider range of risk prediction models, including machine learning (ML) methods.Methods: The effective sample sizes for risk predictions can be expressed as the ratio of two variances, which may be estimated computationally. The performance of such a computational approach was evaluated in simulations. We then illustrated the approach in a clinical dataset (n=23,034) with patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction where we aimed to predict 30-day mortality using five types of risk prediction models: logistic regression, elastic net, XGBoost, neural net, and random forest. Findings: In simulations, the computational approach provided accurate estimates of the effective sample size for the logistic regression and elastic net models, while small deviations were noted for XGBoost, the random forest, and the neural net. While model performance metrics were similar across models, there were large differences in effective sample sizes and risk predictions on the individual level in the clinical dataset.Interpretation: Prediction uncertainty at the individual level can be substantial even when predictions algorthims are developed with large sample size. The expression as effective sample size provides a promising tool to communicate the trustworthiness of the predicted risk to individual users of ML-based prediction algorithms.},
