	abstract = {Clinical prediction models provide risk estimates for the presence of disease (diagnosis) or an event in the future course of disease (prognosis) for individual patients. Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often subopti-mal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodo-logical rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.},

Doctor: It means that I don't know exactly how many of the 100 men will be alive 5 years later, but I expect between 62 and 78 will. My best guess is still 70, but this is a range for my guess. Patient: Does that mean at least 62 but no more than 78 will be alive? Doctor: No, but fewer than 62 or more than 78 is quite unlikely. Patient: Where does the 95\% come in? Doctor: The casual interpretation is that there is only a 5\% chance that fewer than 62 or more than 78 men will be alive in 5 years. Technically, that's not correct. Instead, all I can say is that if I repeated my work of estimating that interval an infinite number of times, 95\% of my infinite attempts would successfully include the true risk that you face. Of course, I can't make a definitive statement about the particular interval I just quoted for you.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Clinical prediction models are estimated using a sample of limited size from the target population, leading to uncertainty in predictions, even when the model is correctly specified. Generally, not all patient profiles are observed uniformly in model development. As a result, sampling uncertainty varies between individual patients' predictions. We aimed to develop an intuitive measure of individual prediction uncertainty. The variance of a patient's prediction can be equated to the variance of the sample mean outcome in hypothetical patients with the same predictor values. This hypothetical sample size can be interpreted as the number of similar patients that the prediction is effectively based on, given that the model is correct. For generalized linear models, we derived analytical expressions for the effective sample size. In addition, we illustrated the concept in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In model development, can be used to balance accuracy versus uncertainty of predictions. In a validation sample, the distribution of indicates which patients were more and less represented in the development data, and whether predictions might be too uncertain for some to be practically meaningful. In a clinical setting, the effective sample size may facilitate communication of uncertainty about predictions. We propose the effective sample size as a clinically interpretable measure of uncertainty in individual predictions. Its implications should be explored further for the development, validation and clinical implementation of prediction models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Clinical prediction models estimate an individual's risk of a particular health outcome. A developed model is a consequence of the development dataset and model‐building strategy, including the sample size, number of predictors, and analysis method (e.g., regression or machine learning). We raise the concern that many models are developed using small datasets that lead to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}instability{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} in the model and its predictions (estimated risks). We define four levels of model stability in estimated risks moving from the overall mean to the individual level. Through simulation and case studies of statistical and machine learning approaches, we show instability in a model's estimated risks is often considerable, and ultimately manifests itself as miscalibration of predictions in new data. Therefore, we recommend researchers always examine instability at the model development stage and propose instability plots and measures to do so. This entails repeating the model‐building steps (those used to develop the original prediction model) in each of multiple (e.g., 1000) bootstrap samples, to produce multiple bootstrap models, and deriving (i) a {\textless}italic{\textgreater}prediction instability plot{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} of bootstrap model versus original model predictions; (ii) the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}mean absolute prediction error{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (mean absolute difference between individuals’ original and bootstrap model predictions), and (iii) {\textless}italic{\textgreater}calibration, classification, and decision curve instability plots{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} of bootstrap models applied in the original sample. A case study illustrates how these instability assessments help reassure (or not) whether model predictions are likely to be reliable (or not), while informing a model's critical appraisal (risk of bias rating), fairness, and further validation requirements. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: The SAVVY project aims to improve the analyses of adverse events (AEs), whether prespecified or emerging, in clinical trials through the use of survival techniques appropriately dealing with varying follow-up times and competing events (CEs). Although statistical methodologies have advanced, in AE analyses, often the incidence proportion, the incidence density, or a non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator are used, which ignore either censoring or CEs. In an empirical study including randomized clinical trials from several sponsor organizations, these potential sources of bias are investigated. The main purpose is to compare the estimators that are typically used to quantify AE risk within trial arms to the non-parametric Aalen-Johansen estimator as the gold-standard for estimating cumulative AE probabilities. A follow-up paper will consider consequences when comparing safety between treatment groups.
Methods: Estimators are compared with descriptive statistics, graphical displays, and a more formal assessment using a random effects meta-analysis. The influence of different factors on the size of deviations from the gold-standard is investigated in a meta-regression. Comparisons are conducted at the maximum follow-up time and at earlier evaluation times. CEs definition does not only include death before AE but also end of follow-up for AEs due to events related to the disease course or safety of the treatment.
Results: Ten sponsor organizations provided 17 clinical trials including 186 types of investigated AEs. The one minus Kaplan-Meier estimator was on average about 1.2-fold larger than the Aalen-Johansen estimator and the probability transform of the incidence density ignoring CEs was even 2-fold larger. The average bias using the incidence proportion was less than 5\%. Assuming constant hazards using incidence densities was hardly an issue provided that CEs were accounted for. The meta-regression showed that the bias depended mainly on the amount of censoring and on the amount of CEs.
Conclusions: The choice of the estimator of the cumulative AE probability and the definition of CEs are crucial. We recommend using the Aalen-Johansen estimator with an appropriate definition of CEs whenever the risk for AEs is to be quantified and to change the guidelines accordingly.},

It makes it possible to calculate the incidence rate of events like recovery of renal function, myocardial infarction or death by using information from all subjects at risk for these events. It explains how the method works, how survival probabilities are calculated, survival data can be summarized and survival in groups can be compared using the logrank test for hypothesis testing. In addition, it provides some guidance regarding the presentation of survival plots. Finally, it discusses the limitations of the Kaplan–Meier method and refers to other methods that better serve additional purposes.},

	abstract = {Background/Aims
There is some consensus among authors of reports of clinical studies that a measure of follow-up time is informative for the interpretation of the Kaplan Meier estimate of the survivor function of the event time of interest. Previous authors have suggested that length of follow-up is important to report because the findings of a study should be extracted from the time frame in which most of the subjects have had the event or have been remained under observation. This time frame is where the Kaplan Meier estimate is most stable. This concept of stability is relative to the potential maximum information about the event time distribution contained in the sample; it is not relative to the true, population survivor function. A measure of stability is useful for the interpretation of an interim analysis in which an immature survivor function is presented. Our interest in this paper lies in characterizing the unobserved, complete follow-up Kaplan Meier estimate based on the observed, partial follow-up estimate. Our focus is not on characterizing the true event time distribution relative to its estimate. The concept of stability has not been well-defined in the literature, which has led to inconsistency and lack of transparency across trials in their attempts to capture it through a variety of measures of follow-up.

Methods
We report the results of a survey of recent literature on cancer clinical trials, and summarize whether follow-up is reported and if so, if it is well-defined. We define commonly used measures of follow-up in clinical studies.

Results
We explain how each measure should be assessed to evaluate the stability of the Kaplan Meier estimate for the event and we identify relationships among measures. We propose a new measure that better conveys the desired information about the stability of the current Kaplan Meier estimate relative to one based on complete follow-up. We apply the proposed measure to a meningioma study for illustration.

Conclusions
It is useful for reports of clinical studies to supplement Kaplan Meier estimates with quantitative assessments of the stability of those estimates relative to the potential follow-up of study participants. We justify the use of one commonly used measure and we propose a new measure that most directly accomplishes this goal.},

Design  A survey of stakeholders’ opinions on the proposals. Setting  A web-based survey, open to international participation, for those with an interest in visualisation of time-to-event data. Participants  1174 people participated in the survey over a 6-week period. Participation was global (although primarily Europe and North America) and represented a wide range of researchers (primarily statisticians and clinicians). Main outcome measures  Two outcome measures were of principal importance: (1) participants’ opinions of each proposal compared with a ‘standard’ Kaplan–Meier plot; and (2) participants’ overall ranking of the proposals (including the standard).
Results  Most proposals were more popular than the standard Kaplan–Meier plot. The most popular proposals in the two categories, respectively, were an extended table beneath the plot depicting the numbers at risk, censored and having experienced an event at periodic timepoints, and CIs around each Kaplan–Meier curve.
Conclusions  This study produced a high response number, reflecting the importance of graphics for time-toevent data. Those producing and publishing Kaplan–Meier plots—both authors and journals—should, as a starting point, consider using the combination of the two favoured proposals.},

This new estimator approximates the true variance by a Binomial variance formula, where the proportion parameter is a piecewise non-increasing function of the Kaplan–Meier survival function and its upper bound, as described below. Also, the effective sample size equals the number of subjects not censored prior to that time. In addition, we consider an adjusted hybrid variance estimator that modifies the regular estimator for small sample sizes. We present a simulation study to compare the performance of the regular and adjusted hybrid variance estimators to the Greenwood and Peto variance estimators for small sample sizes. We show that on average these hybrid variance estimators give closer variance estimates to the true values than the traditional variance estimators, and hence confidence intervals constructed with these hybrid variance estimators have more nominal coverage rates. Indeed, the Greenwood and Peto variance estimators can substantially underestimate the true variance in the left and right tails of the survival distribution, even with moderately censored data. Finally, we illustrate the use of these hybrid and traditional variance estimators on a data set from a leukaemia clinical trial. Published in 2004 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper shows that the proposed confidence limits are asymptotically correct for continuous survival data. These intervals, as well as those based on the arcsine transformation, the logit transformation and the log(-log) transformation, are compared by simulation to those based on Greenwood's formula-the usual method of interval estimation in life-table analysis. With large amounts of data, the alternatives to the Greenwood method all produce acceptable intervals. On the basis of overall performance, the intervals suggested by Rothman are preferred for smaller samples. Any of these methods may be used to generate confidence sets for the median survival time or for any other quantile.},

The number of events with regard to the defined primary endpoint required to ensure the specified power can be calculated according to Schoenfeld's formula like in classical survival studies. However, determination of the number of patients that have to be recruited to observe the calculated number of events requires specification of the length of the accrual period, the trial duration and assumptions about the event-specific hazard functions. Information from previous studies about expected failure rates for the reference treatment is useful and can be translated into assumptions about the appropriate model parameters. A formula for sample size computation is presented for two competing outcome states. Nomograms help to communicate different alternatives of duration and size of the trial to interdisciplinary committees whose members plan and monitor the clinical trial. The 4D trial (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie) designed to compare lipid lowering treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin with placebo in type 2 diabetic patients on hemodialysis with respect to time to the composite event “cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction” is used as an example to outline the statistical methods.},

Using data from an online experiment conducted on Airbnb users, we investigate which of the two types of reputation information --average star rating or the number of reviews --is more important for signaling a user's trustworthiness. We find that the relative effectiveness of ratings and reviews differ depending on whether reputation has a strong or a weak differentiation power. Our findings show that reputation effects are contingent on and susceptible to the context created by the alternative choices presented to users, highlighting how reputation information is displayed can drastically alter their efficacy for engendering trust.},

DESIGN: Randomized, concurrently controlled clinical trial.
SETTING: Major cancer centers, universities, and community clinics affiliated with the North Cancer Treatment Group, the Southwest Oncology Group, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.
PATIENTS: Those who had had curative-intent resections of stage III colon cancer in the previous 1 to 5 weeks.
INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned to observation only, to levamisole alone (50 mg orally three times/d for 3 days, repeated every 2 weeks for 1 year), or to this regimen of levamisole plus fluorouracil (450 mg/m2 body surface area intravenously daily for 5 days and then, beginning at 28 days, weekly for 48 weeks).
MEASUREMENTS: Rates of cancer recurrence and death. Early- and late-treatment side effects.
RESULTS: With all 929 eligible patients able to be followed for 5 years or more (median follow-up, 6.5 years), fluorouracil plus levamisole reduced the recurrence rate by 40\% (P {\textless} 0.0001) and the death rate by 33\% (P = 0.0007). Levamisole reduced the recurrence rate by only 2\% and the death rate by only 6\%. With few exceptions, toxicity was mild and patient compliance was excellent. No evidence of late side effects was seen.
CONCLUSION: Fluorouracil plus levamisole is tolerable adjuvant therapy to surgery; it has been confirmed to substantially increase cure rates for patients with high-risk (stage III) colon cancer. It should be considered standard treatment for all such patients not entered into clinical trials.},

Consequently, clinicians rely on predictive models that estimate the probability of lymph node metastases and other pathologic features from clinical factors such as the clinical T stage, the grade in the biopsy specimen, and the serum prostate-specific antigen level. These models do not, however, directly predict prognosis. In developing a tool for predicting the probability that prostate cancer might recur after treatment, we took a novel approach that focused on the risk for the individual patient. In particular, we chose to develop a tool that calculates a continuous probability of recurrence rather than placing the patient in a risk group. This represents a fundamental departure from the classical goal of staging; a departure we argue is long overdue. Clinically localized prostate cancer patients deserve the most accurate and tailored predictions available, which current staging systems do not provide. Such an individualized approach should add value in medical decision making whenever an accurate prediction of the outcome may guide treatment selection.},

Levamisole plus 5-FU, and to a lesser extent levamisole alone, reduced cancer recurrence in comparison with no adjuvant therapy. These differences, after correction for imbalances in prognostic variables, were only suggestive for levamisole alone (P = .05) but quite significant for levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .003). Whereas both treatment regimens were associated with overall improvements in survival, these improvements reached borderline significance only for stage C patients treated with levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .03). Therapy was clinically tolerable with either regimen and severe toxicity was uncommon. These promising results have led to a large national intergroup confirmatory trial currently in progress.},

	abstract = {Twelve hundred ninety-six patients with resected colon cancer that either was locally invasive (Stage B2) or had regional nodal involvement (Stage C) were randomly assigned to observation or to treatment for one year with levamisole combined with fluorouracil. Patients with Stage C disease could also be randomly assigned to treatment with levamisole alone. The median follow-up time at this writing is 3 years (range, 2 to 5 1/2). Among the patients with Stage C disease, therapy with levamisole plus fluorouracil reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 41 percent (P{\textless}0.0001). The overall death rate was reduced by 33 percent (P ≈ 0.006). Treatment with levamisole alone had no detectable effect. The results in the patients with Stage B2 disease were equivocal and too preliminary to allow firm conclusions. Toxic effects of levamisole alone were infrequent, usually consisting of mild nausea with occasional dermatitis or leukopenia, and those of levamisole plus fluorouracil were essentially the same as those of fluorouracil alone — i.e., nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, dermatitis, and leukopenia. These reactions were usually not severe and did not greatly impede patients' compliance with their regimen. We conclude that adjuvant therapy with levamisole and fluorouracil should be standard treatment for Stage C colon carcinoma. Since most patients in our study were treated by community oncologists, this approach should be readily adaptable to conventional medical practice. (N Engl J Med 1990; 322:352–8.) THIS year, cancer of the colon will afflict over 100,000 persons in the United States.1 As a cause of death due to cancer, it is second only to lung cancer. There is no established means of preventing colon cancer, and there is no reliable and cost-effective means of screening to ensure early diagnosis. In the main, symptomatic patients must be treated as they present themselves, and in half of them cure has unfortunately not been possible. However, in about 80 percent of patients the diagnosis is made at a stage when all apparent diseased tissue can be surgically removed. In . . .},

The challenge is to communicate the inherent scientific uncertainty — especially about the underlying quality of the evidence — whilst supporting informed decision making. Little is known about the effects that such scientific uncertainty has on people’s judgments of the information. In three experimental studies (total N=6,489), we investigate the influence of scientific uncertainty about the quality of the evidence on people’s perceived trustworthiness of the information and decision making. We compare the provision of high, low, and ambiguous quality-of-evidence indicators against providing no such cues. Results show an asymmetric relationship: people react more strongly to cues of low quality of evidence than they do to high quality of evidence compared to no cue. While responses to a cue of high quality of evidence are not significantly different from no cue; a cue of low or uncertain quality of evidence is accompanied by lower perceived trustworthiness and lower use of the information in decision making. Cues of uncertain quality of evidence have a similar effect to those of low quality. These effects do not change with the addition of a reason for the indicated quality level. Our findings shed light on the effects of the communication of scientific uncertainty on judgment and decision making, and provide insights for evidence-based communications and informed decision making for policy makers and the public.},

In the “posttruth” era where facts are increasingly contested, a common assumption is that communicating uncertainty will reduce public trust. However, a lack of systematic research makes it difficult to evaluate such claims. We conducted five experiments—including one preregistered replication with a national sample and one field experiment on the BBC News website (total n = 5,780)—to examine whether communicating epistemic uncertainty about facts across different topics (e.g., global warming, immigration), formats (verbal vs. numeric), and magnitudes (high vs. low) influences public trust. Results show that whereas people do perceive greater uncertainty when it is communicated, we observed only a small decrease in trust in numbers and trustworthiness of the source, and mostly for verbal uncertainty communication. These results could help reassure all communicators of facts and science that they can be more open and transparent about the limits of human knowledge.},

	abstract = {Objective
Shared decision-making (SDM) is advocated as the model for decision-making in preference-sensitive decisions. In this paper we sketch the history of the concept of SDM, evidence on the occurrence of the steps in daily practice, and provide a clinical audience with communication strategies to support the steps involved. Finally, we discuss ways to improve the implementation of SDM.
Results
The plea for SDM originated almost simultaneously in medical ethics and health services research. Four steps can be distinguished: (1) the professional informs the patient that a decision is to be made and that the patient's opinion is important; (2) the professional explains the options and their pros and cons; (3) the professional and the patient discuss the patient's preferences and the professional supports the patient in deliberation; (4) the professional and patient discuss the patient’s wish to make the decision, they make or defer the decision, and discuss follow-up. In practice these steps are seen to occur to a limited extent.
Discussion
Knowledge and awareness among both professionals and patients as well as tools and skills training are needed for SDM to become widely implemented.
Practice Implications
Professionals may use the steps and accompanying communication strategies to implement SDM.},

We show and illustrate with an example that if the PH assumption is violated, the results of interim analyses can be heavily biased. This is due to the fact that the censoring pattern in interim analyses can be completely different from the final analysis. We argue that, when the PH assumption is violated, interim analyses are only sensible if a fixed time horizon for the final analysis is specified, and at the time of the interim analysis sufficient information is available over the whole time interval up to the horizon. We show how the bias can then be remedied by introducing in the estimation and testing procedures an appropriate weighting that reflects the weights to be expected in the final analysis. The consequences for design and analysis are discussed and some practical recommendations are given. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
